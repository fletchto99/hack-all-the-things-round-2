The image is a bmp file. You will need to edit the binary of the file. Specifically the Bifmap file header
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Bitmap_file_header

the beginning of the file looks like:
42 4d 50 30 12 00 00 00 00 00 16 27 09 00 28
To get the original it should look like:
42 4d 50 30 12 00 00 00 00 00 36 00 00 00 28
