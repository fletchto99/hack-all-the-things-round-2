The cipher was generated using the tool here.
Although this tool is propriatary, the characters representations are taken from the Zodiac Killer's 408 cipher.

This is a substitution cipher but is more complex since the same character can be represented by many symbols.
No spaces or special characters exist in this type of cipher.
The last several characters are just filler to reach the end of the row. They are to be discarded.
The centered zodiac symbol at the bottom of the message is a signature. This should help in identifying the type of cipher.
